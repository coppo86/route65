  <h3>Route 65</h3>
  <p class="a">We are a band of six fun loving folk who came together through a love of music - especially sing along, foot tapping sixties stuff when women were real women and music was real music!</p>
  <p>We met through the University of the Third Age (U3A) and had so much in common we decided to form a band. Route 65 has been going for around 5 years now though we had a bit of an extended enforced break recently</p> 
  <p>We all live in or around the A65 Ilkley/Menston area of Yorkshire,the inspiration for the band name.</p> 
  <p>If we ever forget where we live, (Good evening officer!) - the band name serves the dual purpose of helping the emergency services get us home - should that ever be needed. </p>

  <h3>About Us</h3>
<img class="wrap" src="images/band1.jpg" alt="The band"  width="50%" align=”right” >
  <p>We are a six piece semi-acoustic band that plays at gigs ranging from community care homes to pub gardens, large outdoor fetes and just about everything in between.</p>
  <p>We have two different setups depending on the size of event: A small busker amplifier arrangement for the smaller events and a full public address rig for larger spaces and outdoor events.</p>
  <p>Our main aims are for the audience (and ourselves) to have fun dancing or singing along on a trip down memory lane. Along the way we raise money for charity. </p>
  <p>Charges: We aim to support charities so don't charge as such - giving 95% of whatever income we have to three main charities. We do accept bribes of tea and cake or occasionally a beer however. For non charity events such as private parties we suggest a minimum donation which we distribute to our preferred charities. We can talk this through if you are looking to book the band. </p>
